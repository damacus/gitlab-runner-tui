{"id":"gitlab-runner-tui-vfc","title":"BUG: Runners still may not display tags — fetch_runner_detail enrichment needs diagnosis","description":"The GitLab `/runners/all` list endpoint does NOT return `tag_list`, `version`, or `revision` in its response body (confirmed via official GitLab 18.4 API docs). We added `fetch_runner_detail` enrichment to call `GET /runners/:id` for each runner, which DOES return these fields. However, the enrichment uses `unwrap_or(r)` — if detail fetch fails silently (permissions, rate limits, timeout), tags remain empty.\n\nRoot cause analysis needed:\n1. Verify `fetch_runner_detail` actually succeeds against real GitLab (may need `admin` scope for `/runners/:id`)\n2. The mock tests use response bodies that include `tag_list` in the list endpoint — this doesn't reflect real API behavior\n3. No logging/tracing when detail enrichment fails — failures are swallowed silently\n4. No concurrency limit on parallel detail fetches — may hit API rate limits causing silent failures\n\nAdditionally, the `tag_list[]` query parameter format may be wrong. GitLab docs show `tag_list` as a \"string array\" param but don't specify the exact encoding. It may need `tag_list=tag1,tag2` instead of `tag_list[]=tag1\u0026tag_list[]=tag2`.","acceptance_criteria":"- Add tracing::warn when fetch_runner_detail fails so failures are visible in logs\n- Add a concurrency limit (e.g., 10) to parallel detail fetches via futures::stream::buffer_unordered\n- Verify tag_list query param encoding matches GitLab API expectations\n- Update mock test response bodies to match real /runners/all response (no tag_list, no version)\n- Add integration-style test that verifies enrichment pipeline: list → detail → merge","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"dan.webb@damacus.io","created_at":"2026-02-11T10:53:22.482689Z","created_by":"Dan Webb","updated_at":"2026-02-11T12:14:00.446692Z","closed_at":"2026-02-11T12:14:00.446692Z","close_reason":"Implemented: added tracing::warn on detail/manager failures, buffer_unordered(10) concurrency limit, error_for_status on managers, fixed mock fidelity, added conductor tests","labels":["api","bug","tags"]}
